# Smart Contract Tutorial

::: warning NOTE
This tutorial was designed to work with CosmWasm v0.8.
:::

In this tutorial, we will set up a local testnet environment for smart contract development, and help find your bearings by writing, uploading, and interacting with your first smart contract. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a complete working dApp that works with your custom token issued on the Terra blockchain.
