# My Terra Token

::: warning NOTE
This tutorial was designed to work with CosmWasm v0.8.
:::

In this tutorial, we will set up a local testnet environment for smart contract development, and help find your bearings by writing, uploading, and interacting with your first smart contract. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a complete working dApp that works with your custom token issued on the Terra blockchain.

### Requirements

For this tutorial, we recommend:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your machine
- familiarity with the **concepts** of Terra
- enough familiarity with Rust to be _conversant_
